# Dear Friends of Emit,

As I sit down to write this, my heart is filled with a mix of emotions - gratitude, nostalgia, and a tinge of sadness. Today marks a significant moment in our journey together.
I want to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to each and every one of you. Our time together on Emit has been nothing short of extraordinary. From late-night conversations to spontaneous laughter, we've shared moments that I'll forever cherish.
To the incredible team of developers behind Emit, I owe a debt of gratitude. Your dedication, passion, and ingenuity have brought our shared vision to life. Without your tireless efforts, none of this would have been possible.
It's with a heavy heart that I share the news: Emit has begun its sunset process. This decision wasn't easy, but it's a necessary step as we navigate the ever-changing landscape of technology and communication.
For all of us, this means saying goodbye to Emit. It's not just a messaging platform; it's been our digital home, a place where friendships flourished and memories were made. While Emit may be fading into the sunset, the bonds we've formed will endure.
As we bid farewell to Emit, let's carry forward the spirit of community and connection that defined our time here. Let's stay in touch, seek out new adventures, and continue to support each other along the way.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being part of this journey. May the future hold endless possibilities and may our paths cross again.


With warm regards,
Carson Day, Lead Developer & Founder
